=head1 NAME

Parse::Distname - parse a distribution name

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Parse::Distname 'parse_distname';
    my $info = parse_distname('ISHIGAKI/Parse-Distname-0.01.tar.gz');
    
    # for compatibility with CPAN::DistnameInfo
    my $info_obj = Parse::Distname->new('ISHIGAKI/Parse-Distname-0.01.tar.gz');
    say $info_obj->dist; # Parse-Distname

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parse::Distname is yet another distribution name parser. It works
almost the same as L<CPAN::DistnameInfo>, but Parse::Distname takes
a different approach. It tries to extract a version part of a
distribution and treat the rest as a distribution name, contrary to
CPAN::DistnameInfo which tries to define a name part and treat
the rest as a version.

Because of this difference, when Parse::Distname parses a weird
distribution name such as "AUTHOR/v1.0.tar.gz", it says the name
is empty and the version is "v1.0", while CPAN::DistnameInfo
says the name is "v" and the version is "1.0". See test files
in this distribution if you need more details. As of this writing,
Parse::Distname returns a different result for about 200+
distributions among about 320000 BackPan distributions.

=head1 FUNCTION

Parse::Distname exports one function C<parse_distname> if requested.
It returns a hash reference, with the following keys as of this
writing:

=over 4

=item arg

The path you passed to the function. If what you passed is some kind
of an object (of Path::Tiny, for example), it's stringified.

=item cpan_path

A relative path to the distribution, whose base directory is
assumed CPAN/authors/id/. If org_path doesn't contain a pause_id,
the distribution is assumed to belong to LOCAL user. For example,

  say parse_distname('Dist-0.01.tar.gz')->{cpan_path};
  # L/LO/LOCAL/Dist-0.01.tar.gz

If you only gives a pause_id, parent directories are supplemented.

  say parse_distname('ISHIGAKI/Dist-0.01.tar.gz')->{cpan_path};
  # I/IS/ISHIGAKI/Dist-0.01.tar.gz

=item pause_id

The pause_id of the distribution. Contrary to the above, this is
empty if you don't give a pause_id.

  say parse_distname('Dist-0.01.tar.gz')->{pause_id};
  # (undef, not LOCAL)

=item subdir

A PAUSE distribution may be put into a subdirectory under the author
directory. If the name contains such a subdirectory, it's kept here.

  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/sub/Dist-0.01.tar.gz')->{subdir};
  # sub

Perl 6 distributions are (almost) always put under Perl6/
subdirectory under each author's directory (with a few exceptions).

=item distv

The name and version of the distribution, without an extension and
directory parts, which should not be empty as long as the
distribution has an extension that PAUSE accepts.

  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/sub/Dist-0.01.tar.gz')->{distv};
  # Dist-0.01

=item dist

The name part of the distribution. This may be empty if no valid
name is found

  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/sub/Dist-0.01.tar.gz')->{dist};
  # Dist
  
  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/v0.1.tar.gz')->{dist};
  # (empty)

=item version

The version part of the distribution. This also may be empty, and
this may not always be a valid version, and may have a following
part such as C<-TRIAL>.

  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/Dist.tar.gz')->{version};
  # (undef)
  
  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/Dist-0.01-TRIAL.tar.gz')->{version};
  # 0.01-TRIAL

=item version_number

The first numerical part of the version. This also may be empty, and
this may not always be a valid version.

  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/Dist-0.01-TRIAL.tar.gz')->{version_number};
  # 0.01
  
  say parse_distname('AUTHOR/Dist-0_0_1.tar.gz')->{version_number};
  # 0_0_1

=item extension

The extension of the distribution. If no valid extension is found,
parse_distname returns false (undef).

=item is_perl6

For convenience, if subdir exists and it starts with Perl6/,
this becomes true.

=item is_dev

If the version looks like C<\d+.\d+_\d+>, or contains C<-TRIAL>,
this becomes true. PAUSE treats such a distribution as a developer's
release and doesn't list it in its indices.

=back

=head1 METHODS

For compatibility with CPAN::DistnameInfo, Parse::Distname has the
same methods/accessors, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement.

In addition, C<is_perl6> and C<version_number> are available.
